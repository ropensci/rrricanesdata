# rrricanesdata

`rrricanesdata` is the complementary dataset for [rrricanes](https://github.com/ropensci/rrricanes). Currently it contains all product datasets for every cyclone that has developed in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific basins since 1998.

`rrricanesdata` will be updated on the first of every month.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites.

## Installing

`rrricanesdata` can be installed with the following command:

```r
install.packages("rrricanesdata", 
                 repos = "https://timtrice.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
```

This package is not nor will be made available in CRAN.

### Updating

As `rrricanesdata` will be updated monthly (provided any advisory was issued the previous month), you will want to ensure you have the latest datasets prior to running any analysis. You need to add the package repository to your `repos` options, such as:

```r
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), "https://timtrice.github.io/drat/")
```

You can then run `update.packages` to check for and install any new updates.

## Known Data Quality Issues

1. Hurricane Juan (AL152003), Adv 15; no status leads to improper `Status` and `Name` values in some datasets. ([#82](https://github.com/ropensci/rrricanes/issues/82))
